# What is this?

A building block for Amazon's infrastructure-as-code CDK toolkit to deploy a NextJS app using AWS serverless services.
Supported NextJs versions: >=12.3.0+ (includes 13.0.0+)

Your NextJS app is packaged using OpenNEXT to fit the serverless format on Lambda

# Quickstart

### NextJS setup

Add a dev dependency `esbuild@0.17.16` to your NextJS project.

```shell
npm install --save-dev esbuild@0.17.16
```

### CDK Construct

Use this construct in your CDK application to deploy your NextJS app to AWS.

<details>
  <summary>Typescript</summary>

  ```shell
  npm install --save-dev esbuild@0.17.16 open-next-cdk
  ```

  ```ts
  import { Nextjs } from 'open-next-cdk';

  new Nextjs(this, 'Web', {
    nextjsPath: './web', // relative path to nextjs project root
  });
  ```
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Java</summary>

  ```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.dataspray</groupId>
    <artifactId>open-next-cdk</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
  </dependency>
  ```

  ```java
  Nextjs.Builder.create(this, getConstructId())
          .nextjsPath("./web")
          .build();
  ```
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Go</summary>

  ```shell
  go get github.com:datasprayio/open-next-cdk.git
  ```
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Python</summary>

  ```shell
  pip install open-next-cdk
  ```
</details>
<details>
  <summary>.NET</summary>

  ```shell
  dotnet add package Dataspray.OpenNextCdk
  ```
</details>
<br/>

This will automatically build your NextJS app and package it for you as part of the CDK construct.

If you would prefer to package it separately, see below:

### Build manually

Build NextJs using open-next:

```shell
open-next build
```

You will find a new folder `.open-next` which contains the packaging for your NextJS App. Now you can use the construct by instructing it not to build your app, just use the OpenNEXT folder directly:

```ts
import { Nextjs } from 'open-next-cdk';

new Nextjs(this, 'Web', {
  nextjsPath: './web', // relative path to nextjs project containing .open-next folder
  isPlaceholder: true, // Do not build, assume .open-next folder already exists
});
```

# Additional security
```ts
import { RemovalPolicy, Stack } from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { CfnWebAcl } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-wafv2";
import { SecurityPolicyProtocol, type DistributionProps } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront";
import { Nextjs, type NextjsDistributionProps } from "cdk-nextjs-standalone";
import { Bucket, BlockPublicAccess, BucketEncryption } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3";

// Because of `WebAcl`, this stack must be deployed in us-east-1. If you want
// to deploy Nextjs in another region, add WAF in separate stack deployed in us-east-1
export class UiStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
    const webAcl = new CfnWebAcl(this, "WebAcl", { ... });
    new Nextjs(this, "NextSite", {
      nextjsPath: "...",
      defaults: {
        assetDeployment: {
          bucket: new Bucket(this, "NextjsAssetDeploymentBucket", {
            autoDeleteObjects: true,
            removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
            encryption: BucketEncryption.S3_MANAGED,
            enforceSSL: true,
            blockPublicAccess: BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL,
          }),
        },
        distribution: {
          functionUrlAuthType: FunctionUrlAuthType.AWS_IAM,
          cdk: {
            distribution: {
              webAclId: webAcl.attrArn,
              minimumProtocolVersion: SecurityPolicyProtocol.TLS_V1_2_2021,
            } as DistributionProps,
          },
        } satisfies Partial<NextjsDistributionProps>,
      },
    });
  }
}
```

# About

Deploys a NextJs static site with server-side rendering and API support. Uses AWS lambda and CloudFront.

There is a new (since Next 12) [standalone output mode which uses output tracing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing) to generate a minimal server and static files.
This standalone server can be converted into a CloudFront distribution and a lambda handler that handles SSR, API, and routing.

The CloudFront default origin first checks S3 for static files and falls back to an HTTP origin using a lambda function URL.

## Benefits

This approach is most compatible with new NextJs features such as ESM configuration, [middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware), next-auth, and React server components ("appDir").

The unmaintained [@serverless-nextjs project](https://github.com/serverless-nextjs/serverless-next.js) uses the deprecated `serverless` NextJs build target which [prevents the use of new features](https://github.com/serverless-nextjs/serverless-next.js/pull/2478).
This construct was created to use the new `standalone` output build and newer AWS features like lambda function URLs and fallback origins.

You may want to look at [Serverless Stack](https://sst.dev) and its [NextjsSite](https://docs.sst.dev/constructs/NextjsSite) construct for an improved developer experience if you are building serverless applications on CDK.

## Dependencies

Built on top of [open-next](https://open-next.js.org/), which was partially built using the original core of cdk-nextjs-standalone.
